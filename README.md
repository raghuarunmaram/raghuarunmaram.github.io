# Hey, Welcome to My Portfolio - Raghu Arun Maram
This is where I keep my personal portfolio website—a space that shows off my skills, projects, and love for data engineering. I built it with a fresh, flexible design that works on any screen, and it’s a reflection of what I can do with real-time data systems and tricky data problems.

## About Me
I’m a Data Engineer who enjoys creating data solutions that are fast, reliable, and ready to grow. This portfolio is my way of sharing what I’m good at, the projects I’ve worked on, and a little peek into who I am. I made it from the ground up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming for something that looks nice and feels easy to use.

## What You’ll Find Here
- **Works Everywhere**: The layout adjusts smoothly whether you’re on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
- **Progress Bar**: A handy little bar that shows how far you’ve scrolled.
- **Easy Navigation**: Click to glide through sections like About, Skills, and Projects.
- **Skill Highlights**: Fun hover effects and animations that pop up as you scroll to show off my tech skills.
- **Project Peek**: Clickable cards that open up to tell you more about my work—what I used and what I achieved.
- **Let’s Connect**: Quick links to my LinkedIn, X, and email so you can reach out.
- **Dark Mode**: A cool, easy-on-the-eyes look with some bright touches.

## How I Built It
- **HTML5**: Keeps everything organized and meaningful.
- **CSS3**: Gives it style with layouts, animations, and a design that fits any screen.
- **JavaScript**: Makes it interactive, like the progress bar and clickable details.
- **Extras**: I pulled in the SF Pro Display font from Google Fonts and added some SVG icons for skills and social links.
